Steps

- Run the code generation to make the shinylive site
- Upload that site to github using git console commands (it is too big for RStudio to handle)
- On github repo, go to "Settings -> Pages", and have the source develop the page from the right directory/branch
- Wait for a while (hour, maybe?). It will then give you the link to a functioning website on the Pages page.
- Note that, I assume, I'll have to rebuild using shiny live for any updates.


PS need bugfix on display of table for chapter 5 probability distribution table.
